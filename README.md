## Introduction

In this site I share a few personal projects I have develop on my free time. While working on them, I have always have the following objectives:
1. Try to **LEARN** new things about Data Science, Data Engineering or Software in general with every project.
2. Build a **USER-FRIENDLY** “final product” allowing people to have fun with it.
3. Last but not least, **ENJOY** the building process!
