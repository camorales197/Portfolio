### Introduction





- Bulleted
- List

While building these projects I have tried to meet the following constraints:
1. Try to **learn** new things with every project. 
2. Create something practical and **useful*.
2. Have the lowest running cost possible (**0€** if possible)
3. Using as much **open source** as possible.
4. Have a product which could scale “infinitely” thanks to **serverless** services.
5. Build a **user-friendly** “final product” allowing people to have fun with it.
6. Last but not least, **enjoy** the building process!
